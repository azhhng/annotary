Like okay, at one point Kaoru can magically go into the simulated Loop world and relive in entirety the events of the first two books, how convenient!<br/><br/>But, despite it all, I understand that horror requires readers to suspend disbelief, which is why I wrote 'a little annoyed' and not 'a lot annoyed'.<br/><br/>I think I am just more mad at myself for having this mindset of not being able to DNF a book because it was so clear from even the second book that what Suzuki wanted to write is not horror but rather sci-fi/philosophy. So can I even blame him when I was the one who forced myself to finish these two books even though I know I am not that interested in these genres?<br/><br/>I think I'm just trying to ask myself the question, 'do I regret finishing the series?'. And I think the answer is 'no'. Even though this book kind of unraveled the entirety of the first book as just being a simulation and there is literally not even a conclusion of HOW the virus even got introduced into Loop (just some throwaway sentences on how there's always a possibility some outside force maliciously injected some virus in Loop!), I still can't deny that, at the very least, this book is very creative.<br/><br/>Ring is one of my favorite horror books ever, and I still remember the chills I felt when it was revealed that the curse was really a virus, so it's a true testament to how much I loved the first book since it's still influencing my entire perspective on this series to be somewhat positive.",true,,2,0
