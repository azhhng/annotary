      "notes": "This book completely blew my mind and made me think deeply about life choices and regret. The concept of a library between life and death where you can explore all the different lives you could have lived is absolutely fascinating. Nora's journey through various alternate realities was both heartbreaking and inspiring. Each life she experienced taught her something valuable about herself and what truly matters. The writing was beautiful and philosophical without being pretentious. It really made me reflect on my own choices and appreciate the life I'm actually living. Some parts were incredibly emotional and had me in tears. The ending was perfect and left me feeling hopeful about life's possibilities. Definitely one of those books that stays with you long after reading.",
